# Rotation_angle_estimation_harmonic  
We propose aggregating a candidate peak and its harmonics as a more robust metric in determining the rotation-dependent peak.

Compared with the state of the arts, the accuracy of image rotation angle estimation can be significantly improved.

## Usage
Please run Onesample_harmonics.m to see the difference between the proposed method and previous ones.
